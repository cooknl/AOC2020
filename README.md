# AOC2020

[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) Solutions and discussion

## Day 01 (Python)

- Learned about [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data)
- Remembered with-open-as
- Remembered [itertools.combinations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations)
- Remembered [math.prod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html?highlight=math#math.prod) isn't built-in
- Writing inputs to a file for local work without hitting server

## Day 02 (Python)

- Started using filename for metadata
- Learned `__file__`
- Learned `l <= n < h` is a valid comparison expression

## Day 03 (Python)

- Used modulus operator `%` to wrap map

## Day 04 (Python)

- Created [aocd_setup.py] to extend automation of `aocd` to capture metadata and data, as well as for submission
- Initially had line splitting, but for some problems it's `\n\n` and for others it's `\n`, so kept it out of [aocd_setup.py]
- Learned that `>=` comparison allows for check of keys in a dictionary against a set of keys
- A lot of confusion on nested for loops about where the key:value split has to occur
- [regex101](https://www.regex101.com) to the rescue, once again
- Learned that `^` and `$` can be important so that the string must be **exactly** `{9}` characters, not a subset of greater than 9 characters

## Day 05 (Python)

- When they say "binary" you can believe them and just convert to unsigned int
- [int()](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#int) has built-in binary string to integer conversion
- `zip(a_list[:-1],a_list[1:])` creates a side-by-side tuple of neighboring list elements without messing with the original `a_list` somehow offset by one
- `lambda` FTW!

## Day 06 (Python)

- Set unions and intersections don't _quite_ work the same way
- Nested list comprehensions ðŸ˜µ

## Day 07 (Python)

- Created `AOCD_DIR` and `AOC_SESSION` environment variable using Powershell, per the [`advent-of-code-data` README](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data/blob/master/README.rst), as I'm on a Win10 machine
  - Per [the PowerShell docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7.1) the PowerShell
  script for this is

  ```PowerShell
    $Env:<variable-name> = "<new-value>"
  ```

  - So, I will now be using

  ```Python
    import os
    os.environ["AOCD_DIR"]
    os.environ["AOC_SESSION"]
  ```

  - [ ] TODO: refactor previous days' code and deprecating the use of `aocd_setup`
- Confirmed that `from aocd import data` saves input data to a file `yyyy_dd_input.txt`
  in the directory `$ENV:AOCD_DIR/$ENV:AOC_SESSION` while making data available to
  the current program as `data`.
- SO MUCH RECURSION
  - SO MUCH RECURSION
    - SO MUCH RECURSION
      - SO...
- Remembering `defaultdict` is useful when you don't want to have keyerrors,
  though maybe it's not strictly necessary here?
- [**MAJOR CONCEPTUAL BREAKTHROUGH**](https://twitter.com/nathangs20/status/1335953455152820230?s=20)
  with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)

## Day 08 (Python)

- A ton of helper functions and keeping track of state with a dictionary
- Brute force exercise for part b

## Day 09 (Python)

- More brute force, again
- `itertools.combinations()` to the rescue, again
- Some hard thinking about the verbiage of part b. Took several tries to read and understand what the problem was asking for
- JUST BECAUSE A TEST PASSES DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE CODE IS CORRECT. Could be a "false positive" in the "test" set

## Day 10 (Python)

- Using the `zip` trick from [Day 05](#day-05), part a was just a matter of counting 1's and 3's from the `diff` of itself
- Part b took a while to ferret out the pattern, which ended up being the ["Tribonacci" sequence](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TribonacciNumber.html) which I used a recursive function to calculate for each set of 1's

  ```Python
  def calc_series(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    else:
        return calc_series(n-1) + calc_series(n-2) + calc_series(n-3)
  ```

## Day 11 (Python)

- Converted characters to numeric to make selections easier
  - `L` -> 0, empty seat
  - `#` -> 1, occupied seat
  - `.` -> -1, floor
- Padded the grid with `-1` floor to assist in neighborhood finding
- Used `numpy` to handle the seating grid and help with indexing and filtering
  - `np.where()`
- Used `itertools.product()` to generate cardinal directions for part b
- Part b marched out along each cardinal direction until hitting a boundary or a seat

## Day 12 (Python)

- Dictionaries for state again, like [Day 08](#day-08)
- Another idea would have been to use complex numbers!

## Day 13 (Python)

- Had a hunch that modulus, `%`, would be helpful, but took a bit of investigation to figure out how
- `min()` takes a `key` keyword argument that lets you select an element based on the result of a `lambda`
- Part b was just...wow. All my brute force was hopeless against the large numbers
  and even my attempt as subtly still had the counter increases by 1, instead of the
  bus ID
- https://joepitts.co.uk/blog/advent-of-code-day-13.html was the spoiler I needed
